                    <h2>Abroad Studies</h2>
                    <p>
                        During my academic journey, I had the privilege of engaging in international study programs that broadened my cultural and academic perspectives.<br>
                        <br>
                        In 2022, I spent a semester at the Università degli Studi di Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale in Italy, where I immersed myself in their educational approach and local culture.<br>
                        <br>
                        Earlier, from 2016 to 2017, I attended St Kieran's College in Kilkenny, Ireland.<br>
                        <br>
                        This experience greatly enhanced my adaptability and appreciation for diverse learning environments, shaping me into a more well-rounded individual.

                    <p>
                        I am currently pursuing a degree in Game Design and Development at Girona University, where I’ve maintained a GPA of 7/10.<br>
                        <br>
                        My studies focus on creating engaging, interactive experiences and honing technical skills in areas like programming, game mechanics, and storytelling.<br>
                        <br>
                        I have enjoyed applying theoretical knowledge to practical projects, which has deepened my passion for designing innovative games.

                    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        My professional journey includes a valuable role as an IT Solutions Developer at Noddon Technology Consulting, where I contributed to solutions for Banco Sabadell.<br>
                        <br>
                        My work involved ServiceNow and JavaScript technologies, which allowed me to gain hands-on experience in workflows, database management, and application development.<br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, I’ve volunteered in diverse environments, such as teaching special education students and assisting administrative staff in Kilkenny.<br>
                        <br>
                        These experiences have enriched my skill set, particularly in communication, organization, and problem-solving.
